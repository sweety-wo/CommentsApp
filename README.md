# Comments App

Welcome to Comments App. I am building a ReactJS app for allowing a user to view comments as well as add their own comment.
 
## Technology Overview

This product uses a fair number of javascript libraries which are listed as below: 
react, react-dom, redux, react-redux, webpack and webpack-dev-server

The app's components lives in `./components`. Redux actions and reducers live in `./actions/actions` and `./reducers/reducers`

### Setup:
```bash
npm install
```

### Run:
```bash
npm start
```

## UX & Design
I have followed basic HTML and CSS specifications for achieving this.
